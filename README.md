The Odin Project landing page

This is the second project for The Odin Project foundations course. The gist of this is to create a landing page for a fake business using basic HTML and CSS. 

Font used is Roboto from Google Fonts.

Thoughts after completing the landing page project:
The lesson on flex boxes make moving objects around on the page a lot easier. When I would learn CSS previously, flexboxes would come in later in the lesson so I would be stuck with formatting a webpage with the normal flow only. Seeing the page slowly come together with the new skills I learned was great! I'm looking forward to continuing these lessons and maybe coming back to this project to update the site with even more things I have learned.
